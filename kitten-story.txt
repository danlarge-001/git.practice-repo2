The Lost Kitten

One sunny morning, Afi was walking to school when she heard a soft meow coming from the bushes. She stopped and looked around. There, hiding under the leaves, was a tiny kitten with bright green eyes.

The kitten looked scared and hungry. Afi knelt down and held out her hand. "Come here, little one," she said gently. Slowly, the kitten stepped forward and sniffed her fingers.

Afi looked around. There were no houses nearby, and no one seemed to be looking for a lost kitten. "I can’t leave you here," she said. So, she picked up the kitten and placed it in her schoolbag, leaving the top open so it could peek out.

At school, her teacher, Madam Esi, saw the kitten and smiled. "That’s a kind thing you did, Afi," she said. "But we need to find its owner."

After school, Afi and her friends made a small sign: "Lost Kitten Found! Please Call Us." They placed it near the market where many people passed by.

The next day, an old woman came to the school. "That’s my kitten!" she said happily. "Her name is Mimi. She went missing two days ago."

Afi smiled as she handed the kitten to the woman. "Goodbye, Mimi!" she said, feeling happy inside.

The woman thanked Afi and gave her a warm hug. "You have a kind heart, my dear," she said.

That night, Afi felt proud. Helping someone—even a small kitten—had made her day special.
